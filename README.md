# Demystifying Segmentation

Segmentation is one of the key techniques in computer vision for unraveling the intricate details of visual data. It essentially involves partitioning an image into distinct regions, where each region corresponds to a meaningful object or area of interest. This technique forms the foundation for many advanced applications, ranging from object recognition and medical imaging to autonomous vehicles and augmented reality.Â 

Let's see it in action. Below is a video from a farm, in which segmentation is being used to identify horses.
